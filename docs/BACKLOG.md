# Pokémon GO Planner — Backlog

Last reviewed: 18 September 2026

This file is the durable home for **confirmed but unshipped work** and explicitly deferred/rejected ideas that would otherwise exist only in project chats.

It is intentionally different from the other repository references:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes how the system works now.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` records durable decisions and shipped PR history.
- `README.md` explains user/developer/operator usage.
- `AGENTS.md` defines the development and release workflow.
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` records work that has **not shipped yet**.

## Backlog rules

1. Chat history is not a durable backlog. A future idea matters after chat cleanup only if it is captured here or explicitly reintroduced by the user.
2. Add only:
   - confirmed user-requested future work;
   - verified technical debt or known defects;
   - intentionally deferred work with a clear reason.
3. Do not turn speculative assistant suggestions into active requirements.
4. When an item ships, remove it from Active/Deferred in the same PR and record the shipped result in the `docs/DECISIONS.md` PR lineage.
5. When an item is rejected, move it to **Not planned** with the reason rather than leaving it ambiguous.
6. Newest explicit user direction and newest `main` always outrank this file.
7. Never create a production migration solely because an item appears here. Inspect current production state and follow the normal migration/release workflow.

## Active

No confirmed active backlog items are currently recorded.

## Deferred

No confirmed deferred feature commitments are currently recorded.

## Not planned

### NP-001 — Lightweight "My Max Team" / Pokémon roster tracking

A possible feature was discussed where the Planner could store a small set of owned Dynamax/Gigantamax Pokémon and Max Move levels to estimate battle readiness.

It is **not planned** at present.

Reasons:

- the user questioned whether the feature was actually necessary;
- Max boss weaknesses and battle guidance do not require maintaining a personal Pokémon roster;
- the current product principle is to track goals and scarce resources rather than become a full Pokémon storage/team manager.

Revisit only if the user explicitly asks for owned-team/readiness tracking and the benefit justifies the additional data-entry and maintenance complexity.

## Chat-cleanup audit

The Max Battle work that was discussed in the long-running project conversation has already been implemented and durably recorded through the merged Max-related PRs and the architecture/decision documents.

BL-001 was resolved after the production D1 definitions for `event_suppression_rules` and `remote_raid_daily_budget_overrides` were inspected directly and reconciled into the repository schema, migration path, and regression coverage.

The remaining durable item identified from the available project conversation context and current repository audit is the explicitly non-planned Max-team tracking idea above.

No other confirmed unimplemented commitment was identified during this audit. Future work should not infer requirements from deleted chat history; it should use newest `main`, the durable docs, this backlog, and the user's current request.
